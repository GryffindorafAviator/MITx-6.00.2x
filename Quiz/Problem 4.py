# Problem 4
# 0.0/20.0 points (graded)
# Consider a list of positive (there is at least one positive) and negative numbers. 
# You are asked to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence. For example,

# in the list [3, 4, -1, 5, -4], the maximum sum is 3+4-1+5 = 11
# in the list [3, 4, -8, 15, -1, 2], the maximum sum is 15-1+2 = 16
# Write a function that meets the specification below.

# def max_contig_sum(L):
#     """ L, a list of integers, at least one positive
#     Returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in L """
#     #YOUR CODE HERE
    
# Paste your entire function in the box below. Do not leave any print statements.
