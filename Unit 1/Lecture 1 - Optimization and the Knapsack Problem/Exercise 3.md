# Exercise 3
3/3 points (graded)

For these questions, you'll be asked to give the big-O upper bound runtime for some Python functions. In your answer, please omit the "O( )" portion of the answer and simply write a mathematical expression.

Use +, -, / signs to indicate addition, subtraction, and division. Explicitly indicate multiplication with a * (ie say "6*n" rather than "6n"). Indicate exponentiation with a caret (\^) (ie "n\^4" for n^4 ). Indicate base-2 logarithms with the word log2 followed by parenthesis (ie "log2(n)").

What this all means is if an answer is, for example, 

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
  <mstyle displaystyle="true">
    <mi>O</mi>
    <mrow>
      <mo>(</mo>
      <msup>
        <mi>n</mi>
        <mn>4</mn>
      </msup>
      <mo>)</mo>
    </mrow>
  </mstyle>
</math>  
, please simply write "n\^4" in the box.

1. What is the big-O upper bound runtime for the function 
    ```
    look_for_things 
    ```
    ,
    where n is defined as the number of elements in 
    ```
    myList
    ```
    ?
    
    ```
    NUMBER = 3
    def look_for_things(myList):
    """Looks at all elements"""
    for n in myList:
    if n == NUMBER:
        return True
    return False
    ```
    ```
    n
    ```
    
1. What is the big-O upper bound runtime for the function 
    ```
    look_for_other_things
    ```
, where n is defined as the number of elements in 
```
myList
```
?
```
NUMBER = 3
def look_for_other_things(myList):
    """Looks at all pairs of elements"""
    for n in myList:
        for m in myList:
            if n - m == NUMBER or m - n == NUMBER:
                return True
    return False
```
```
n^2
```

1. What is the big-O upper bound runtime for the function 
    ```
    look_for_all_the_things
    ```
    , where n is defined as the number of elements in 
    ```
    myList
    ```
    ?
    You do not need to account for the runtime of 
    ```
    get_all_subsets
    ```
    ; the code is provided so you can see how many subsets it generates, as that will be a factor in your answer.
    ```
    def get_all_subsets(some_list):
    """Returns all subsets of size 0 - len(some_list) for some_list"""
    if len(some_list) == 0:
        # If the list is empty, return the empty list
        return [[]]
    subsets = []
    first_elt = some_list[0]
    rest_list = some_list[1:]
    # Strategy: Get all the subsets of rest_list; for each
    # of those subsets, a full subset list will contain both
    # the original subset as well as a version of the subset
    # that contains first_elt
    for partial_subset in get_all_subsets(rest_list):
        subsets.append(partial_subset)
        next_subset = partial_subset[:] + [first_elt]
        subsets.append(next_subset)
    return subsets
NUMBER = 3
def look_for_all_the_things(myList):
    """Looks at all subsets of this list"""
    # Make subsets
    all_subsets = get_all_subsets(myList)
    for subset in all_subsets:
        if sum(subset) == NUMBER:
            return True
    return False
    ```
    
    ```
    2^n
    ```
